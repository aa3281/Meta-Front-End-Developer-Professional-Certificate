### Course 2 - Programming with Javascript ###
JavaScript is the programming language that powers the modern web. In this course, you will learn the basic concepts of web development with JavaScript. You will work with functions, objects, arrays, variables, data types, the HTML DOM, and much more. You will learn how to use JavaScript and discover interactive possibilities with modern JavaScript technologies. Finally, you will learn about the practice of testing code and how to write a unit test using Jest.

### Course 3 - Version Control ###
You will be introduced to some of the most commonly used Linux commands that you can use to work with files on your hard drive and create powerful workflows that will automate your work, saving you time and effort. Finally, you will see how Git can be used in software development projects to manage team files—and you will create a repository that can manage code revisions.

**By the end of this course, you will be able to:**
- Implement Version Control systems.
- Navigate and configure using the command line.
- Manage code revisions.
- Create and use a GitHub repository.

For the final project, you will demonstrate your knowledge of project management in GitHub by performing tasks such as forking and cloning a repository, updating a file, and pushing updates to a repository.

### Course 4 - HTML and CSS in Depth ###
You’ll use software development tools like HTML to build attractive web pages that work well—and you’ll use structured semantic data to control how websites appear to the end user.

You will then dive deeper into CSS by applying increasingly specific styling to various elements. You’ll learn to use Bootstrap’s grid system to create  layouts and work with components and themes. Finally, you’ll explore debugging and learn how it can be utilized to banish common front-end errors.

### Course 5 - React Basics ###
React is a powerful JavaScript library that you can use to build user interfaces for web and mobile applications (apps). In this course, you will explore the fundamental concepts that underpin the React library and learn the basic skills required to build a simple, fast, and scalable app.

### Course 6 - Advanced React ###
In this course, you will learn advanced React concepts. You’ll examine different types of React components, learn various characteristics and when to use them. You’ll start working with hooks, effects and other functional components. You’ll find out how routing is used in React to customize the users' experience, you’ll create a web application that consumes API data, and you'll get familiar with the most commonly used React framework integrations, tools, and debugging approaches.

### Course 7 - Principles of UI/UX Design ###
Learn the fundamentals of User Experience (UX) research and design, such as how UX insights relate to design decisions and how accessibility affects users. You will get a brief tour in modern User Interface (UI) design, learning the basics of Figma, and understanding the importance of micro interactions.

By utilizing the UI design process, you will create Minimum Viable Product (MVP) style prototypes from your mockups.

Finally, you will be introduced to some methods of data design and the roles of templates and Content Management Systems (CMS).

### Course 8 - Front-End Developer Capstone ###
The Capstone project enables you to demonstrate multiple skills from the Certificate by solving an authentic real-world problems. This course will test your knowledge and understanding, and provide you with a platform to show off your new abilities in front-end web development using React.

On completion of the Capstone project, you’ll have a job-ready portfolio that you can show to recruiters, demonstrate during interviews and impress potential future employers.

### Course 9 - Coding Interview Preparation ###
The final course in this program will help prepare you for the unique aspects of a coding job interview, with approaches to problem solving, computer science foundations and soft skills needed to land the job.

You’ll gain strategic insights and tips for successful interviewing. And, you’ll have the opportunity to openly discuss the emotional components of the interview process with other learners taking this course.
